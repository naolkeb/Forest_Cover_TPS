# Forest Cover Classification

In this project, I will be working a kaggle data set for the TPS december competition. I will be predicting a categorical target based on a number of feature columns given in the data. The dataset is used for this competition is synthetic, but based on a real dataset and generated using a CTGAN. This dataset is based off of the original Forest Cover Type Prediction competition. I use two neural networks for a soft voting scheme between the two.
