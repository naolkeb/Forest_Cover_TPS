# Forest Cover Classification

In this project, I will be working a kaggle data set for the TPS december competition. I will be predicting a categorical target based on a number of feature columns given in the data. The data is synthetically generated by a GAN that was trained on a the data from the Forest Cover Type Prediction. I use two neural networks for a soft voting scheme between the two.
